# Changelog — ekdosi

Notable changes to the **ekdosi app** (Laravel + Filament). Format:
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). The app ships continuously
(no SemVer tag yet), so changes are grouped under `[Unreleased]` and dated as
they merge.

> **The WHMCS-side plugin has its own log:**
> `whmcs-plugin/ekdosi_bridge/CHANGELOG.md`.
> **Deep archive** (dated inspection notes, per-PR review logs):
> `docs/CLAUDE-history.md`. This file starts at 2026-06 — older history lives
> in that archive + git.
>
> **Discipline (from 2026-06 on):** every PR adds a line here under
> `[Unreleased]` (Added / Changed / Fixed / Removed). On a release cut, rename
> `[Unreleased]` to the dated/versioned heading.

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- **Data Import — Epsilon Smart Sales → invoices** (Phase 2): the «Epsilon
  Smart (JSON)» tab gains a Πωλήσεις (`DataExport-Sales.json`) slot. Each Epsilon
  sale lands as a historical, already-filed invoice — `active` + `mydata_state=
  VALID` + the MARK (leading apostrophe stripped) + a minimal `mydata_marks`
  audit row. Counterpart resolved by ΑΦΜ (resolve-or-create), lines mapped from
  CommLines (product matched by name), the Epsilon DocNum kept as the ΑΑ and the
  invoice-type counter bumped so new ekdosi invoices continue. Re-runnable by
  `(company_id, invcode)`; a re-run refreshes the header and replaces lines + the
  mark row (`EpsilonImporter::importSales`).
### Added
- **Data Import — Epsilon Smart (JSON)** (Phase 1): the «Firebird Import» screen
  is renamed «Data Import» and gains a 2nd tab. The Firebird flow is unchanged
  (its own tab); the new «Epsilon Smart (JSON)» tab imports the Τιμολόγηση
  exports — **Customers** (match by ΑΦΜ) and **Items/Services → products** (VAT
  from the Epsilon class, unit, category; WhosalePrice as the net sell price).
  Re-runnable upsert by natural key; resolves against the standard AADE lookups
  the seeder installs (`App\Services\Etl\EpsilonImporter`). Runs synchronously
  (the exports are tiny). Sales→invoices is a planned Phase 2.

## 2026-06-02
### Added
- **Fresh-install seeding** (PR #152): a new Greek/myDATA tenant auto-installs
  the standard AADE lookups — VAT categories (§8.2) + invoice types pre-classified
  by-the-book (mydata_type + E3 income class + category) + payment methods (§8.12),
  distribution aims, metric units, delivery methods, product categories. Idempotent
  «Εισαγωγή τυπικών» buttons on each Setup list; runs on UI Create-Company +
  `db:seed`.
- **Tags** (PR #150): tenant-scoped tags on customers / suppliers / products /
  invoices / expenses — multi-select filter + Έξοδα-style fast-filter tabs (count
  badges) + bulk attach; managed via a `TagResource`.
- **Favourites-first pickers** (PR #150): `is_favorite` ⭐ on invoice types /
  customers / products; the invoice + quote pickers show favourites then most-used
  on open. Inline product create, Είδος→dimensions auto-fill, «Νέο Παραστατικό»
  from the customer Καρτέλα, full Greek labels on the invoice form.
### Changed
- ETL `copyLookup` now ADOPTS a pre-seeded lookup row by its natural key (stamps
  its legacy_id) so a re-import converges on one row instead of duplicating the
  seeded «Μετρητά» / «24%» / «ΤΕΜ» (PR #152).
### Removed
- Inert legacy `mailed` / `printed` / `email_sent` flags on invoices (PR #151).

## History
Earlier changes (tenancy/auth, customers + Καρτέλα, invoices + VAT math + QR/PDF,
myDATA submit/cancel/reconcile, payments + credit notes, Έξοδα/Ε3, Quotes, VIES,
roles, activitylog, the WHMCS bridge A–B3 + timologia v2) predate this file —
see `docs/CLAUDE-history.md`, `docs/Comparison.md`, and git history.
