# Backlog / Roadmap — deferred ideas

Cross-cutting TODOs that are **deliberately not built yet**. Captured so they
don't get lost in drift. (Per-feature plans live in their own docs:
`services-quotes-roadmap.md`, `expenses-phase-plan.md`,
`einvoice-provider-bridge.md`. The myDATA-filing gaps + tech-debt list live in
`CLAUDE.md`.)

## UX — customer/product pickers: tags + favourites-first dropdown

**Asked for, deferred 2026-05-31.** On the invoice/quote line forms (and the
header customer picker), the operator wants the dropdowns to surface the
common customers/products first instead of only showing results after typing.

Decided shape (NOT a plain `is_favorite` boolean — go with tags so we can also
filter the list tables):

1. **Tags on `customers` and `products`** — a reusable tag/label system (e.g.
   «συχνός», «χονδρική», «hardware»). Must also be **filterable in the
   Customers / Products list tables**, not just used by the pickers.
   - Open question: dedicated `tags` + pivot, or `spatie/laravel-tags`
     (already in the Laravel ecosystem), or a simple per-model JSON column.
     Tags need to be tenant-scoped (`company_id`) either way.

2. **Picker behaviour: «Αγαπημένα/tagged πρώτα + Show all»**
   - On open (before typing): show the tagged/favourite set.
   - Typing: normal `getSearchResultsUsing` search **as today** — keep it
     working unchanged; just bias tagged rows to the top
     (`orderByDesc(<tagged>)`).
   - A «Show all» affordance to browse beyond search (for occasional
     full-catalogue browsing without preloading thousands of rows).
   - Applies to: InvoiceForm + QuoteForm line `product_id`, and the header
     `customer_id` on both.

**Why deferred:** tags are a small feature of their own (schema + tag CRUD UI +
table filters + picker wiring). Not worth bolting on mid-form-redesign;
revisit as a focused slice.
